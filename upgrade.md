# Upgrade from 0.x.y to 1.0.0

## JSON-KD / Company info

Support for JSON-LD has been removed for now. It may be added back to 2.0 in a more useful way. 
The blueprint `fields/companyInfo` has been removed, too. You may copy the blueprint from the latest 0.x version and use it directly in your setup.
